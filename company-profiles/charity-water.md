# charity: water

## Company blurb

charity: water is a non-profit bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations. Since 2006, we've funded over 29,725 water projects in 26 developing countries. When complete, these projects will provide clean, safe drinking water for more than 8.4 million people.

Nearly 663 million people donâ€™t have access to clean drinking water, that's one in ten of us. Diseases from dirty water kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war.

The good news: there are simple solutions, from deep drilled wells to water filtration systems. And with the help of 1M+ donors and individual fundraisers, we're forming a strong force against the water crisis. Join us!
