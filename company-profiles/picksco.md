# PicksCo (The Picks & Shovels Co.)

## Company blurb

At PicksCo we are building tools and products (see [Interchange](http://interchangehq.com/)) for institutional investors and traders of cryptoassets. We value diversity of experience and perspective, and welcome interest from anyone who wants to help us solve hard problems and deliver a great experience to our users.

You can read more about how we started and what's motivating us [on Medium](https://medium.com/interchange/introducing-interchange-from-the-picks-shovels-co-ea891352eede).

## Company size

We are an early-stage company and currently have 0-10 employees.

## Remote status

We have been a fully distributed company from day one, and have (and continue to) put a lot of thought and effort into creating a remote culture that promotes communication but also respects each team member's need for focus time. We are continually iterating on our processes as a team to improve on these two fronts.

## Region

Currently all employees are based in the US, but we are open to working with anyone who resides within the GMT -7 (Pacific Time) and +1 (Central European Time) zones.

## Company technologies

Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo, React, AWS

## Office locations

No physical office, but the team meets for week-long "on-sites" in various destinations 3-4 times per year. Frequency may change as team grows.

## How to apply
