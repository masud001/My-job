## Company blurb

We believe that colleges and universities should spend less on administration and more on teaching and research. The part we play in making that belief a reality is to simplify higher education processes with thoughtfully designed open source software delivered from the cloud. We know that higher education software typically sucks, and we're trying to stand out by paying attention to design and working closely with our customers.

We think everyone should love their work, and we give our employees lots of autonomy and zero micromanaging. Our benefits package puts us in the top 1% of US companies for quality. You'll enjoy a 401(k) with 100% matching up to 4%, unlimited vacation (we'll bug you if you don't take any), end-of-year weeklong shutdown, quarterly hack weeks, fully covered health/dental/short- and long-term disability insurance premiums for you and your family, generous yearly tech/office budget, $2k/year for conferences/books/classes, and lots of fun, professional people to learn from.

## Company size

Around 100 employees

## Remote status

About half the company works in our beautiful Lehi, Utah office. Some teams choose to be in-office only, and other teams are fully-remote. Everyone at the company works remotely on Thursdays so that even the in-office folks understand the unique issues that come with remote work. As we grow, we are moving _towards_ remote and not the other direction.

For most positions we'll fly you out to Lehi, UT yearly for a company meet-up and send you to our yearly industry conference, [Kuali Days](http://kualidays.com/). You also might meet in-person with your product team and/or functional group once every year. That's likely to be the extent of your time away from home.

## Region

All of our customers and employees are in the USA, and we currently are focused on that region only.
