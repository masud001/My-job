# Tipe

## Company blurb

At Tipe, we're set out to change how teams manage content for all their applications. We're constantly building and experimenting with new designs to solve challenging problems that enable collaboration and visual editing experiences. 

We're a YC startup founded by open source engineers. The tech we use is mostly bleeding edge and we move fast. Most importantly, we do everything together, and everyone has a voice. From playing exploding kittens to design sprints, we like to hangout. We're solving problems around how teams manage content for today's apps. There are big challenges from dev tools to decoupled content editors.
