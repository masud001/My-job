# Hotjar

## Company blurb

Hotjar is a powerful product that reveals the online behavior and voice of a website’s users. By combining both analysis and feedback tools, Hotjar gives the ‘big picture’ of how to improve a site's user experience and performance / conversion rates. Our team work on the compelling challenges that come with large-scale web traffic and analytics, on a product that has a real impact on the thousands of users we support around the world. We work in an agile environment, 100% remotely, and  actively encourage both personal and professional growth; always be learning is one of our core values.

Headquartered on the beautiful island of Malta, in the ‘heart’ of the Mediterranean, Hotjar is a successful start-up that operates on a fully remote basis, and with a key emphasis on personal development.

Spread throughout the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia, our team casts a wide net across a multitude of locations, lifestyles and backgrounds. It’s our differences that make us interesting, and our shared belief in Hotjar’s core values that bind us together.

Hotjar's culture is driven by respect, transparency, collaboration and direct feedback. We have no room on our team for disrespect, office politics or discrimination of any kind. We're obsessed with communicating with our users as well as within the team. We hate bureaucracy and slow moving organizations – but we're suckers for well-defined processes. We love lean, iterative improvements, and success is measured by the value we create for our users.

## Company size

We’re at 65 people and growing!

## Remote status

100% remote. We do have an office (in Malta), though we wouldn’t all fit in it at once. We’ve been completely remote from the outset - we’d rather our team work how and where makes the most sense to them, rather than being unproductive in an office all day.

## Region

Our Product & Engineering team is based almost exclusively in Europe and Africa. The number of North American outliers might grow but it’s EMEA for now. The rest of the company stretches into the Americas also.

Our locations are based on timezones - we have certain timezone restrictions for each role (anywhere within EMEA for P&E) and don’t mind where you are or how much you move around within those timezones.

## Company technologies

Our back-end is built in **Python**, our front-end is built in **AngularJS** and our databases are a mix of **PostgreSQL** and **HBase**.

Other tidbits:
* As of Sept 2017, we have 18 app servers sitting behind the Amazon ELB load balancer.
* We monitor server performance using NewRelic.
* We use StatusCake and VictorOps to notify us whenever something goes wrong.
* We send events to Intercom and Mixpanel for our marketing team to use.
* We log errors (both JavaScript and Python) to Graylog.
* We use four types of persistent data storage: PostgreSQL, HBase, S3 and Elasticsearch.
* We use Lua embedded in Nginx to process incoming data
* We use Amazon's SES service to send emails to our users.
