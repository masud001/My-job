# Equal Experts Portugal

## Company blurb

We established our Portuguese office in 2015, extending the cost-efficient, high-quality model we’ve pioneered in London over the last decade.

EE Portugal’s close proximity, competitive costs and highly-skilled workforce make our Lisbon office a key part of Equal Experts’ offering.

As part of the Equal Experts family, EE Portugal is structured to the same award-winning model we follow elsewhere. We focus on recruiting highly-experienced software practitioners who can self-organise to deliver the greatest possible value – as soon as possible. This brings better results, at lower cost – which we’re pleased to pass onto our clients.

Of course, EE Portugal is also part of Lisbon’s thriving software development community, and we’re thrilled to be at the heart of one of Europe’s fastest-growing tech hubs.
