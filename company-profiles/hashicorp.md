# HashiCorp

## Company blurb

HashiCorp is focused on building software that can provision, secure, and run any application on any infrastructure.

[The Tao of HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/tao-of-hashicorp) is the foundation that guides HashiCorp's vision, roadmap, and product design. As you evaluate joining the company, it may be valuable to understand the motivations and intentions for their work.

## Company size

400+ employees worldwide

## Remote status

The company has an office in San Francisco where ~10% employees are present (some C-level folks, Finance and mostly non-engineering roles), the rest are remote. Most teams are distributed. Some positions may not be available in all regions listed below, but most (esp. engineering ones) are.

Hiring process is fully remote for most roles and successful candidates are flown to the SF office for a week, for on-boarding. HashiCorp also hosts HEX (HashiCorp Employee eXchange) event every year to provide an opportunity for employees to match avatars to real faces and meet everyone.

Teams heavily rely on different forms of asynchronous (RFC, PRD, Google Spreadsheets/Docs, Google Groups, email) and synchronous (Slack, Zoom) communication where necessary and appropriate.
