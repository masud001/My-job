# Dev Spotlight

## Company blurb

At Dev Spotlight, you’ll impact millions of software developers and DevOps engineers. We create content to teach best practices, solve problems, learn the latest trends, and design better architectures. With so much low quality content out there, we raise the bar by hiring the best expert developers and investing time to create the best solutions. Our content is frequently top-ranked in Google and on the front page of online communities like Reddit and Hacker News.

You’ll work with the latest technologies and trends, which is a fun way to grow your skills. It’s a great feeling when the community loves your work and it’s an opportunity to grow your personal portfolio and brand. Due to our short project cycles, you’ll deliver work in weeks. You’ll get variety instead of being stuck with the same systems for years. No more unrecognized time spent on maintenance, fighting fires, and projects that get cancelled after months of work.
