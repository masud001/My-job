# 10up, A WordPress Development Agency

## Company size

125 and growing, spread across web engineering, systems, design, project management, strategy/accounts, and operations.

## Remote status

10up didn’t integrate remote work – we intended to be remote from the start! Being remote allows us to find talent no matter where they're located, scale up to meet needs with relative fluidity, and have been bootstrapped from the start. We also recognize the challenges of working remotely, and put a lot of effort into in-person meetups, communication tools, and ensuring that employees have the benefits and support they need no matter where they are.

## Region

We have employees all around the world, from across the US to the UK to South Africa to the Philippines. Most are currently located in North America, a number travel frequently, and some even work nomadically.

## Company technologies

* WordPress
* PHP
* Sass
* Git
* Vagrant
* Nginx
* Memcache

## Office locations

None; or everywhere!
