# 10up, A WordPress Development Agency

## Company blurb

We make websites and content management simple and fun with premiere web design & development consulting services, by contributing to open platforms like WordPress, and by providing tools and products (like [PushUp](https://pushupnotifications.com/)) that make web publishing a cinch.

At 10up, we don’t just “make” things – we engineer them. We’re a group of people built to solve problems; made to create; wired to delight. From beautiful pixels to beautiful code, we constantly improve the things around us, applying our passions to our clients’ projects and goals.

We’ve had the privilege of working on big web projects for clients as diverse as TechCrunch, ESPN’s FiveThirtyEight and Grantland, SurveyMonkey, Junior Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), and Google.
