<p>We employ several strategies to ensure an inclusive and collaborative environment for all our employees.</p>

<p>To communicate we use <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> (text-chat), our own product <a href="https://talky.io">Talky</a> (video chat and meetings), <a href="https://twistapp.com">Twist</a> (daily check-ins) and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (organization wide discussions).</p>

<p>One-on-ones and bi-weekly company-wide updates are a crucial part of staying connected and understanding our team as things change. We encourage employees to use these meetings to bring up frustrations, ideas, or whatever they need in order to be their best selves and to do their best work.</p>

<p>At least once a year we organize an in-person all-hands team week. It&#x2019;s the best.</p>
