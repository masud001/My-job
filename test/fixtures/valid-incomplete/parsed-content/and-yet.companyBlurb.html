<p><a href="https://andyet.com">&amp;yet</a> is about people. We&#x2019;re known as a design and development consultancy (specializing in Node, React, and realtime), but we don&#x2019;t fit neatly in a box.</p>

<p>We design and <a href="https://andyet.com/software">develop custom software</a> for web, mobile, desktop, chat, and voice.</p>

<p>We enable millions of people to make super simple video calls with <a href="https://talky.io">Talky</a>.</p>

<p>We pioneer software and standards for <a href="https://andyet.com/realtime">realtime communications</a>.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://gatherthepeople.com">wrote the book</a> on taking a human approach to marketing for people who would rather make what they love than persuade people to buy it.</p>

<p>We create high-impact conference experiences such as <a href="http://experience.realtimeconf.com">RealtimeConf</a> and more recently&#x2013;<a href="http://andyetconf.com">&amp;yetConf</a>.</p>
