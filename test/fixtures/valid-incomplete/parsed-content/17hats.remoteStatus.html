<p>Every engineer on our team works remotely. That being said, we do need someone who can work California business hours (9am-6pm PST) and who is available for emergencies at night. If you live in the LA area, you are welcome to be in our cool office in Pasadena. Bonus points if you can curse in Dutch.</p>
